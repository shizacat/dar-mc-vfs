What's this?
This is a package to add support for dar archives to the Midnight 
Commander.

How to add dar archive handling to Midnight Commander.
1) Copy the file udar to the $MCDIR/extfs/ directory.
2) Add the contents of addextfs.ini to the $MCDIR/extfs/extfs.ini file.
3) Add the contents of addbindings to $HOME/.mc/bindings if this file 
   is present. If this file is not present you can create one by choosing 
   "Command" "Edit extension file". To have dar support for all users one 
   might want to add the contents to the $MCDIR/mc.ext file.

N.B. $MCDIR is the directory where all global Midnight Commander settings 
     are stored. The location can be found by typing "mc -f".
